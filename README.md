# Network_config_EIGRP
This project simulates a network with four routers using EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) in Cisco Packet Tracer. It demonstrates inter-network communication with multiple subnets and serial/Ethernet interfaces, providing a hands-on experience in configuring and troubleshooting EIGRP in real-world scenarios.
